/**
 * @module behaviors
 * Headless helpers to build styled components (one file each, or the whole set
 * via the `@nemanjan00/qrp/behaviors` barrel): `portal`, `dismissable`,
 * `trapFocus`, `anchored`, `disclosure`, `busyWhile`. Compose them: a modal is
 * `portal` + `trapFocus` + `dismissable`; a dropdown is `anchored` +
 * `dismissable` + `disclosure`. You bring the markup and CSS; they carry the
 * platform and a11y hard parts. UI built outside a render (a modal from an
 * onclick) should wrap its build in `scoped()` so its effects are owned.
 *
 * Each teardown-returning behavior (`portal`, `dismissable`, `trapFocus`,
 * `anchored`) also registers its undo with the current scope via `onDispose`, so
 * building them inside `scoped()`/`mount()` means `dispose()` alone tears down
 * effects AND behaviors — you don't have to collect the undos by hand. The undos
 * stay returned and are idempotent, so calling one manually is still fine.
